Example Falcon Service
=======================

This project is an example of a full fledged Falcon API service.
The intended purpose is to show one of the many ways people can build services
with the following features:

* Input Validation
* Simple ORM usage
* Testing
* CLI entrypoint
* Middleware
* Custom Gunicorn Workers

------------

From the cloned source, execute:

.. code-block:: shell

    pip install -e .

Running

Once installed you can run the service using the ``falcon-example`` command.

    config in ``etc/example/config.yml`` to match your configuration.

Running Tests

Install test requirements

.. code-block:: shell

    pip install -r dev-requirements.txt
